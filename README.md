In the introduction to the paper, the writers state that if everything in the universe really was just a computer the the notion of physical computation is empty.


*Experimental Investigations of the Utility of Detailed Flowcharts in Programming.*

This paper investigates the utility of detailed flowcharts as an aid to program composition, comprehension, debuging and modification. In the introduction to the paper the writers show both support and criticism for flowcharts. They also state that after a seris of experiments using naive programmers carried out by Mayer, that while usinf flowcharts may assist programming composition it hinders programming comprehension.

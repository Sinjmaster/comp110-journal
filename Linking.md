All 4 papers are written to determine how far computation can be taken regarding life itself. The first paper looks at if all things compute and if that then makes everything a type of computer. The second paper looks at how detailed flowcharts could infact make programming composition easier however programming comprehension would then become harder. The third paper looks at how computer algorithms could make it easier to get the distance between 2 complex objects in a 3 dimensional space. the fourth paper is about how the 'go to' statement can be considered harmful to code maintenance due to the fact that the multiple iterations would make it harder and harder to go back though the code and find certain 'go to' statements.
